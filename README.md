# To run multiple tests in parallel, install the pytest-xdist plugin:
```shell

```
# Then, use the -n option followed by the number of parallel workers (e.g., 4):
```shell
pytest -n 4
```
# If you want run one test more times download pytest-repeat 
```shell
pip install pytest-repeat
```
and run with --count n
```shell
pytest --count=5
```
# use parallel workers with view details on terminal
